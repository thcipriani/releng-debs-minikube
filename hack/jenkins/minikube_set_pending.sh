# This script creates several Github statuses using the Github API: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/
# This is intended to run before the tests start, so the icons show up on the Github PR and block submit until
# the tests finish.

# The script expects the following env variables:
# ghprbPullId: The pull request ID, injected from the ghpbr plugin.
# ghprbActualCommit: The commit hash, injected from the ghpbr plugin.
# access_token: The Github API access token. Injected by the Jenkins credential provider.
